There are several ways of getting involved and contributing including reporting bugs, improving documentation and tutorials.
Community Guidelines Please be mindful of the LLVM Code of Conduct , which pledges to foster an open and welcoming environment.
Contributing code We don't accept pull-request on GitHub, instead we use Phabricator . At the moment you need to also join this group to enable build and test of your Phabricator revisions.</description></item><item><title>Developer Guide</title><link>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/DeveloperGuide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/DeveloperGuide/</guid><description>This document attempts to describe a few developer policies used in MLIR (such as coding standards used) as well as development approach (such as, testing methods).
Style guide MLIR follows the LLVM style guide. We also adhere to the following (which deviate from or are not specified in the LLVM style guide):
Adopts camelBack ; Except for IR units (Region, Block, and Operation), non-nullable output arguments are passed by non-const reference in general.</description></item><item><title>Open Projects</title><link>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/openprojects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/openprojects/</guid><description>Below is a list of projects that can be suitable for Google Summer of Code (GSOC) or just for someone to get started with contributing to MLIR. See also the &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; issues on the bugtracker. If you're interested in one of these projects, feel free to discuss it on the MLIR section of the LLVM forums or on the MLIR channel of the LLVM discord server. The mentors are indicative and suggestion of first point of contact for starting on these projects.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/Glossary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/Glossary/</guid><description>This glossary contains definitions of MLIR-specific terminology. It is intended to be a quick reference document. For terms which are well-documented elsewhere, definitions are kept brief and the header links to the more in-depth documentation.
Block A sequential list of operations without control flow.
Also called a basic block .
Conversion The transformation of code represented in one dialect into a semantically equivalent representation in another dialect (i.e. inter-dialect conversion) or the same dialect (i.</description></item><item><title>Testing Guide</title><link>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/TestingGuide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:26:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/TestingGuide/</guid><description>Testing is an integral part of any software infrastructure. In general, all commits to the MLIR repository should include an accompanying test of some form. Commits that include no functional changes, such as API changes like symbol renaming, should be tagged with NFC(no functional changes). This signals to the reviewer why the change doesn't/shouldn't include a test.
MLIR generally separates testing into two main categories, Check tests and Unit tests.</description></item></channel></rss>
